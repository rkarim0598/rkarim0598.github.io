Users take a short personality test and fill out a general profile to get results best fit for them through our algorithm. After doing so, users are able to experience the classic swipe mechanics and match for either general or event-specific dating.  After a match is created, users can also chat with each other.  Check out the video for a quick demo!"

We added the ability to add new ethical scenarios through the site and displaying a graphical representation of any given scenario to the user, as well as deploying the site and server to be used in production.  The project was done in an agile environment; we had sprints and sprint reviews, point estimation, etc."

Users could view all the nearby hospitals and the number of beds available at each, as well as view hospital locations on a map and get instructions to each hospital."

Based on your responses, we generate your \"score\" in different categories and try to match you with a tech company similar to you.  The company profiles were created by the group through consensus, so take the matches with a grain of salt."
